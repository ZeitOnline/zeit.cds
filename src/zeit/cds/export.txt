Exporting files to CDS FTP server
=================================

Introduction
------------

zeit.cms exports files to a ``gocept.filestore`` spool (in the ``new``
subdirectory). The goal of ``gocept.cds.main.export`` is to export
these files to an FTP server that implements the Content Drehscheibe
(CDS) protocol. Those files that have been exported are moved to the
``cur`` directory in the spool.

FTP server setup
----------------

In order to test our export procedure, we set up an FTP server first
that we can export to.

We create a temporary directory to hold the FTP files::

  >>> import tempfile
  >>> ftp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

We set up the FTP server next::

  >>> from pyftpdlib import ftpserver

We don't want the FTP server to create all kinds logging messages::

  >>> def dummy_logger(msg):
  ...     pass
  >>> ftpserver.log = dummy_logger
  >>> ftpserver.logline = dummy_logger

A bit dangerous because it might suppress real errors we want to see
during debugging, but on the other hand we don't want the FTP server
(in a separate thread) to spit out a traceback at a random moment
during doctesting::

  >> ftpserver.logerror = dummy_logger

We create an authorizer letting our test user write to ``ftp_dir``::

  >>> authorizer = ftpserver.DummyAuthorizer()
  >>> authorizer.add_user('test', 'testpw', ftp_dir, perm='elradfmw')

We complete the configuration::

  >>> class MyFTPHandler(ftpserver.FTPHandler):
  ...     authorizer = authorizer
  >>> address = ('', 2001)
  >>> ftpd = ftpserver.FTPServer(address, MyFTPHandler)

Normally we'd start the ftp server with ``serve_forever``, but in our
tests we write a custom loop that we can actually shut down in the end
when we set ``stop_serving`` to ``True``. Ignore the following
implementation - it's not important to understand the rest of the
tests::

  >>> import asyncore
  >>> stop_serving = False
  >>> def run_ftp_server():
  ...     map = asyncore.socket_map
  ...     ftpd._map = ftpd.handler._map = map
  ...     while map or ftpserver._tasks:
  ...         if map:
  ...             asyncore.poll(1, map)
  ...         if ftpserver._tasks:
  ...             ftpserver._scheduler()
  ...         if stop_serving:
  ...             ftpd.close_all()

We now start the FTP server (in a separate thread, so the test can
continue)::

  >>> import threading
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=run_ftp_server)
  >>> thread.start()

A filestore to export from
--------------------------

We now create the ``gocept.filestore`` spool we want to export, again
in a temporary directory for testing purposes::

  >>> store_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
  >>> from gocept.filestore import filestore
  >>> fs = filestore.FileStore(store_dir)
  >>> fs.prepare()

Tracking log messages
---------------------

Before we start exporting, we make sure we can track log messages::

  >>> import logging
  >>> import StringIO
  >>> logfile = StringIO.StringIO()
  >>> log_handler = logging.StreamHandler(logfile)
  >>> logging.root.addHandler(log_handler)
  >>> old_log_level = logging.root.level
  >>> logging.root.setLevel(logging.INFO)

A convenience function to display the log file::

  >>> def dumplog():
  ...    print logfile.getvalue()
  ...    logfile.seek(0)
  ...    logfile.truncate()

Main export scenario
--------------------

We put two files in the filestore::

  >>> a = fs.create('a-file')
  >>> a.write('This is the A file')
  >>> a.close()
  >>> b = fs.create('b-file')
  >>> b.write('This is the B file')
  >>> b.close()

We move those files to the ``new`` directory where our export logic
expects them::

  >>> fs.move('a-file', 'tmp', 'new')
  >>> fs.move('b-file', 'tmp', 'new')

Now we finally have enough set up to run the export procedure::
   
  >>> import zeit.cds.main
  >>> zeit.cds.main.export(
  ...     store_dir, 'localhost', 2001, 'test', 'testpw', '/')

We say here we want to export the information in the ``store_dir``
spool to the FTP server we just started on localhost, port 2001. The
user name to log in with is ``test`` and the password is
``testpw``. The directory we want to upload to is the FTP root.

This is the log of a successful export::

  >>> dumplog()
  Accessed filestore ... 
  Connecting to CDS FTP server (host localhost, port 2001, user test)
  Creating lock file: write
  Lock file successfully created: write
  Uploading: a-file
  Moved from 'new' to 'cur': a-file
  Uploading: b-file
  Moved from 'new' to 'cur': b-file
  Removing lock file: write
  Lock file successfully removed: write
  Disconnected from CDS FTP server
  Exiting with success.

Verify whether our upload procedure succeeded. We expect ``a-file``
and ``b-file`` to be in ``ftp_dir`` now:

  >>> import os
  >>> sorted(os.listdir(ftp_dir))
  ['a-file', 'b-file']

They also should have the right contents::

  >>> a = open(os.path.join(ftp_dir, 'a-file'), 'r')
  >>> a.read()
  'This is the A file'
  >>> a.close()
  >>> b = open(os.path.join(ftp_dir, 'b-file'), 'r')
  >>> b.read()
  'This is the B file'
  >>> b.close()

The spool we uploaded from will not have the files in the ``new``
directory anymore::

  >>> os.listdir(os.path.join(store_dir, 'new'))
  []

They have moved to the ``cur`` directory now::

  >>> sorted(os.listdir(os.path.join(store_dir, 'cur')))
  ['a-file', 'b-file']

Nothing in the spool to export
------------------------------

If there is nothing at all in the spool to export (that's the case
now, as we just exported them), we won't even attempt to export::

  >>> zeit.cds.main.export(
  ...     store_dir, 'localhost', 2001, 'test', 'testpw', '/')
  >>> dumplog()
  Accessed filestore ...
  No new files to export.
  Exiting with success.

Lock file (``write``) already exists
------------------------------------

If the lock file (``write``) exists and we try to export, the export
stops and will not occur. The idea is to retry the export at some
later time (a regular cron job will do this automatically) when presumably
the process that has generated the ``write`` file will have removed it.

We first lock down the server::

  >>> f = open(os.path.join(ftp_dir, 'write'), mode='w')
  >>> f.write('Lock file')
  >>> f.close()

We create something to export in the spool::

  >>> f = fs.create('new-file')
  >>> f.write('some new file')
  >>> f.close()
  >>> fs.move('new-file', 'tmp', 'new')

Export::

  >>> zeit.cds.main.export(
  ...     store_dir, 'localhost', 2001, 'test', 'testpw', '/')

The log file will now report that the lock file already exists::

  >>> dumplog()
  Accessed filestore ...
  Connecting to CDS FTP server (host localhost, port 2001, user test)
  Cannot access CDS FTP server as 'write' lockfile exists.
  Exiting.

Remove the manually created lock file::

  >>> os.remove(os.path.join(ftp_dir, 'write'))

Wrong hostname or port
----------------------

We try to FTP to a hostname/port combination where there is no FTP
server at all::

  >>> zeit.cds.main.export(
  ...     store_dir, 'localhost', 2002, 'test', 'testpw', '/')
  >>> dumplog()
  Accessed filestore ...
  Connecting to CDS FTP server (host localhost, port 2002, user test)
  Could not connect to CDS FTP server.
  Exiting with exception:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  FTPOSError: (..., 'Connection refused')
  ...

Wrong authentication
--------------------

We try to FTP but we put in the wrong user/password::

  >>> zeit.cds.main.export(
  ...     store_dir, 'localhost', 2001, 'test', 'secret', '/')
  >>> dumplog()
  Accessed filestore ...
  Connecting to CDS FTP server (host localhost, port 2001, user test)
  Could not connect to CDS FTP server.
  Exiting with exception:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  PermanentError: 530 Authentication failed.
  ...

Nonexistent path on FTP server
------------------------------

When the path doesn't exist on the FTP server we cannot export to it::

  >>> zeit.cds.main.export(
  ...     store_dir, 'localhost', 2001, 'test', 'testpw', '/nonexistent')
  >>> dumplog()
  Accessed filestore ...
  Connecting to CDS FTP server (host localhost, port 2001, user test)
  Error accessing FTP server.
  Exiting with exception:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  PermanentError: 550 No such file or directory.
  ...

Shut down
---------

Now we shut down the FTP server::

  >>> stop_serving = True

We need to wait a little bit here to make sure things cleanly shut down::

  >>> import time
  >>> time.sleep(2)

Accesssing the server while it is down
--------------------------------------

Create another file to export::

  >>> f = fs.create('another-file')
  >>> f.write('something')
  >>> f.close()
  >>> fs.move('another-file', 'tmp', 'new')

Try to export it (to a server that's down)::

  >>> zeit.cds.main.export(
  ...     store_dir, 'localhost', 2001, 'test', 'testpw', '/')
  >>> dumplog()
  Accessed filestore ...
  Connecting to CDS FTP server (host localhost, port 2001, user test)
  Could not connect to CDS FTP server.
  Exiting with exception:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  FTPOSError: (..., 'Connection refused')
  ...

Cleanup
-------

Finally we can clean up the temporary directories::

  >>> import shutil
  >>> shutil.rmtree(ftp_dir)
  >>> shutil.rmtree(store_dir)

We return the logging situation back to normal::

  >>> logging.root.removeHandler(log_handler)
  >>> logging.root.setLevel(old_log_level)
